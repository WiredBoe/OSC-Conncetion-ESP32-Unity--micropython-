# OSC Conncetion ESP32 Unity (micropython)
 Scripts for connect an ESP32 to Unity via OSC. ESP32 scripts uses micropython, you will need a editor like Thonny. This code uses a OSC Git Repo for Unity OSC (https://github.com/robertoranon/OSC-Unity5). We only make it compatible with the ESP32. You have to download the UOSC library (https://github.com/SpotlightKid/micropython-osc) and put it into ESP32 directory. Made with Axel.
